    <p class="index-page-top">This website commemorates the Ulverston men and women who were killed in action in World War One and World War Two or later died of their injuries.</p>

<p class="index-page-top">World War One <a href="/world-war-one/roll-of-honour">Roll of Honour</a></p>

<p class="index-page-top">World War Two <a href="/world-war-two/roll-of-honour">Roll of Honour</a></p>

<p>The first version of this website began as a remembrance project during the centenary year of the end of the Great War of 1914 – 1918 in preparation for GP90, the recreation by The Royal British Legion in August 2018 of the Great Pilgrimage of 1928.</p>

<p>The project aimed to ensure that the 175 men and women who are named on the Ulverston war memorial were not merely recorded as names cast in bronze on plaques attached to the memorial in Market Square but were commemorated as Ulverstonians; real people, loved and mourned by family and friends, and remembered with the deepest respect, admiration and thanks.</p>

<p>In 2025 the original website was expanded to include the people killed in World War Two.</p>

<p>The information collated during this research project has been made available on this website as an open access resource in memory of the fallen. Additional contributions will be gratefully received and uploaded to supplement the database and enrich the information available on the life stories and histories of the Ulverston Fallen of both World Wars commemorated on the Ulverston War Memorial.</p>
