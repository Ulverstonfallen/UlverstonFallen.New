<p>Son of John and Ellen Askew of 2 Back, Sun Street, Ulverston, Lancs.</p>

<p>Albert enlisted into the 4th Battalion of the King’s Own (Royal Lancaster Regiment) on 19 November 1915 in Broughton-in-Furness. Albert’s army medical record states that he was 27 years old when he enlisted but this doesn’t match his census records or the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) record of his death at 25.</p>

<p>Albert was posted overseas on 1 July 1916 and was killed in action on 15 August 1916; he has no known grave.</p>
