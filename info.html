<h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>

<p>The website does not use cookies.</p>

<p>The website does not use local storage to store any personal data about you, such as your email address, name, or phone number.</p>

<p>The filtering function uses local storage of your browser to remember your filter criteria. If you do not clear your browser’s history and cache, your filter criteria will be remembered when you return to the browser. The local storage is only available on this browser. If you change browser on your current computer, or you move to one on another computer, your filter criteria will be lost.</p>

<h2 id="java-script">Java Script</h2>

<p>This website uses Java Script (a programming language) to improve functionality. You might not have heard of it, but don’t worry, most people haven’t.</p>

<p>Virtually all modern websites use Java Script in one way or another. Some are impossible to use if it is disabled. Most will still be usable, but with reduced functionality. The approach of this website is to allow you to view details of the fallen. However, you will not be able to filter the various lists of fallen 
or use the map pages, as these are heavily dependent on Java Script.</p>

<p>You can determine if Java Script is available by going to the World War 1 Map page, it will tell you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>That Java script is not available, because it has been turned off for this website. This is probably because you are aware of Java Script and have chosen to 
disable it. To get full functionality, you need to enable Java Script for this website. If you haven’t disabled it or know nothing about it, then someone who 
uses your computer has almost certainly disabled it. To get full functionality, you need to get that person to enable it for this, or even all websites.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That you are using an old browser such as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. In this case the browser is using an old version of Java Script that is unable to 
run our Java Script.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That Java Script is available, and you have full functionality.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
